# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
    Discord calls and in-person meetings if possible.

2. **Assistance**
    We will have all communication done via Discord. Within 2 days we should respond to each other on Discord. 

3. **Respect**
    Understand that everyone is at a different places regarding their computer science experience.  

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**
    Utilize GitHub to allow for parallel workstreams. In addition, we should also have a meeting every week to check in with each other and assign future work. The following week will be a check on the work that should have been done/worked on. 

5. **Time Commitment** 
    Work should be divided relatively equally so this means no one should have to spend an extended amount of time on this project compared to the others. We will divide the work during one of the weekly meetings such that everyone gets work that will take around the same amount of time.

6. **Conflict Resolution**
    In this case we will have a meeting discuss our issues with each other, and figure out a compromise. If we cannot come to a conclusion then we will approach a TA or a professor and work out the issue at hand.
