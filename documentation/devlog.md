## Week 1 [4/9/23 - 4/16/23)

Ian developed the base of the GUI in PyGame. Features include wall creation, agent randomization, and the buttons to clear, randomize, and run both the algorithms in the future. A cell.py class was created in order to easily represent the squares of our grid. Cells help in the animation of the algorithms as well as they contain properties to describe themselves as paths, walls, agents, or empty. Academic papers from David Silver were read as they contained the theoretical approach we planned to take for both of the algorithms.

## Week 2 [4/16/23 - 4/23/23)

Not a lot was accomplished this week. Ian made some quality of life improvements to GUI and did some code refactoring in the main file for better structure and readability. Akash split the algorithms.py file in two separate files ConflictBasedSearch.py and CooperativeAStar.py for simplicity since two people would most likely be working on a file.

## Week 3 [4/23/23 - 4/30/23)

Group members were extremely busy this week so no work was done. Anes and Akash were in Dallas from the 26th to the 30th for Vex Robotics Worlds. We made a concrete plan since this took away from a whole week of development. Coming back, the Coop A* algorithm would be Anes's workstream and Akash would take on CBS.

## Week 4 [4/30/23 - 5/6/23)

Final week of development, Ian implemented an A* helper method since both algorithms utilize it and made some small QoL adjustments to GUI again. A* is implemented using a Priority Queue and a simple distance heuristic as its cost function. Anes and Akash worked on their respective implementations. Ian worked on putting together the github for turning the project in a human-readable way.
